 * APEX T11 are APEX transactions of type 11 that are generated when a card holder touches a validator
 * reader (ex: bus validator, subway gate). These validation transactions represent the card holder's right to travel
 * on a given route, line, or vehicle. T11s have statuses that indicate if the card holder was allowed to travel
 * or not, and with which conditions. A validation also contains information about the card holder's card, the vehicle,
 * the validator machine, the route, and the time and location of the validation.
